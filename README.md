Create a PHP-based web application that calculates the selling price of products in a hypermarket.
The application should consider the buying price of the products, applicable VAT, a percentage of general expenses (including fuel, HR, marketing, etc.), and a profit margin. 
The application should provide a web form for inputting necessary data and buttons to compute and output VAT, total general expense, profit margin, and the selling price for 10 sampled products.
